        <h1>Are You Depressed ?</h1>
        <p>"Every person has his secret sorrows which the world knows not; and often times we call a man cold when he is only sad."</p>

        <p>Depression is a serious mental health condition characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and loss of interest in activities. It can affect anyone regardless of age, gender, or background, and if left untreated, it can lead to severe consequences.</p>
        <p>Deep learning, a subset of artificial intelligence, has shown promise in detecting depression through various means, including analyzing audio and video recordings. By examining speech patterns, facial expressions, and other cues, deep learning algorithms can provide valuable insights into an individual's mental state.</p>
