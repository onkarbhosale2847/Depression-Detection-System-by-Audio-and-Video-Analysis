        <h1>Welcome to Depression Test</h1>
        <p>Depression is a common mental health disorder characterized by persistent sadness, loss of interest or pleasure in activities, and other symptoms that affect how you feel, think, and handle daily activities. It can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems and can decrease a person's ability to function at work and at home.</p>
        <p>The depression test involves recording both audio and video responses to 10 questions. You'll be prompted with each question, and you'll have the opportunity to provide your answer verbally and visually.</p>
        <p>After completing the test, your recorded responses will be analyzed to provide insights into your mental well-being. It's important to answer each question honestly for accurate results.</p>
